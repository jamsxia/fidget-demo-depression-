This is an engineering project made up of two parts: the physical 3-D modeling and Arduino-based programming for sensors in this cube. In this project, I will mainly
focus on the programming part based on Arduino which relies on C language

A bunch of sensors are involved in this cube(20cm20cm20cm) to achieve various functions including an embed 7-keys piano; a changed mixture of light by slides; 
a changed intensity of light by changing the strength of holding it; a timer with reward mechanism and an analogized pet dog appearance which has different shaking frequency by interacting with the stress

I was inspired when I saw so many people holding a hand-hold size fidget cube on metro when I went to school in high school. It was a mechanical simple one and I want to 
make it more interesting so I add sensors and add programming skills to make a brand new one.
